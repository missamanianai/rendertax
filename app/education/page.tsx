                      Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is your total gross income minus specific deductions. It's a key
                      figure used to determine your eligibility for certain tax benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-2">
                      <strong>AGI includes:</strong> Wages, salaries, tips, interest, dividends, business income,
                      retirement income, and other income.

                    <p className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Marginal Tax Rate:</strong> The tax rate applied to your last dollar of income. The U.S.
                      has a progressive tax system with different tax brackets. As your income increases, you move into
                      higher tax brackets, but only the income within each bracket is taxed at that bracket's rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Effective Tax Rate:</strong> Your total tax divided by your total taxable income. This
                      represents the average rate you pay across all your income and is typically lower than your
                      marginal rate.

                    <p className="mb-2">
                      The U.S. uses a progressive tax system with seven federal income tax brackets. For 2023, these
                      brackets are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Example:</strong> If you're a single filer with $50,000 in taxable income in 2023:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
                      <li>The first $11,000 is taxed at 10% = $1,100</li>
                      <li>The next $33,725 ($11,001 to $44,725) is taxed at 12% = $4,047</li>
                      <li>The final $5,275 ($44,726 to $50,000) is taxed at 22% = $1,160.50</li>
                      <li>Total tax = $6,307.50</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Your marginal tax rate would be 22%, but your effective tax rate would be about 12.6% ($6,307.50 รท
                      $50,000).

                    <p className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Standard Deduction:</strong> A fixed amount that reduces your taxable income, based on
                      your filing status. For 2023, the standard deduction is:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">

                    <p>
                      You should choose whichever gives you the larger deduction. Most taxpayers take the standard
                      deduction, but if your itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction amount, itemizing will
                      save you more in taxes.
